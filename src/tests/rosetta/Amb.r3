; amb: Evaluate a condition with nondeterministic choices.
;      The condition is expressed as a block containing logic and possibly
;      choice variables (words whose values are blocks of alternatives).
;      amb returns TRUE if there exists an assignment of choices that makes
;      the condition succeed; otherwise FALSE.
